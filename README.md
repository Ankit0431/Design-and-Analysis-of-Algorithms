# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of four algorithms:

1. Activity Selection Problem
2. Maximum Possible Equal Sum of 3 Stacks
3. Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree
4. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Solver

## Algorithms

### 1. Activity Selection Problem

#### Overview

The Activity Selection Problem involves selecting the largest set of mutually compatible activities with given start times, deadlines, and profits to maximize total profit.

#### Implementation

The implementation of the Activity Selection Problem algorithm can be found in the file `Activity Selection and MPS.py`. It takes a set of activities as input and returns the maximum profit achievable.

### 2. Maximum Possible Equal Sum of 3 Stacks

#### Overview

Given three stacks of positive numbers, the task is to find the maximum possible equal sum of the stacks with the removal of top elements allowed.

#### Implementation

The implementation of the Maximum Possible Equal Sum of 3 Stacks algorithm can be found in the file `Activity Selection and MPS.py`. It takes three stacks as input and returns the maximum equal sum achievable.

### 3. Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree

#### Overview

Prim's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) in a connected, undirected graph. It helps in minimizing the cost of connecting all vertices in the graph.

#### Implementation

The implementation of Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree can be found in the file `Prims Algorithm.py`. It takes a graph as input and returns the minimum spanning tree.

### 4. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Solver

#### Overview

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Solver finds the longest common subsequence between two DNA sequences, which are represented as strings of characters.

#### Implementation

The implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Solver can be found in the file `Longest Common Subsequence.py`. It takes two DNA sequences as input and returns the length of the LCS as well as the LCS itself.

### 5. Knapsack Problem
#### Overview

The Knapsack Problem involves selecting items to maximize the total value in a knapsack while not exceeding its weight capacity.

#### Implementation

The implementation of the Knapsack Problem algorithm can be found in the file `Knapsack Algorithm.py`. It takes a list of items with their weights and values, as well as the capacity of the knapsack, and returns the maximum value achievable.
