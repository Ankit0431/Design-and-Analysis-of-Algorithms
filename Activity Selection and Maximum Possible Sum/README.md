# Activity Selection Problem & Maximum Possible Equal Sum of 3 Stacks

This repository contains solutions for two problems: the Activity Selection Problem and the Maximum Possible Equal Sum of 3 Stacks. Both problems have real-life applications and are solved using algorithms.

## Activity Selection Problem

### Overview

In the single-machine scheduling problem, we are given a set of n activities Ai. Each activity i has a starting time si, deadline di, and profit pi. At any time instant, we can only perform one activity. Performing an activity i earns a profit pi. The goal is to select the largest set of mutually compatible activities and calculate the total profit generated by the machine.

### Input

- **Activities**: A set of activities, each with a starting time, deadline, and profit.

### Output

- **Selected Activities**: The largest set of mutually compatible activities.
- **Total Profit**: The total profit generated by performing the selected activities.

### Real-life Use Cases

1. **Project Management**: In project management, tasks (activities) often have start times, deadlines, and associated profits. By selecting the most profitable and mutually compatible activities, project managers can optimize resource utilization and maximize project profitability.
2. **Conference Scheduling**: Conference organizers need to schedule sessions, workshops, and other activities within a limited time frame. By selecting the most relevant and non-overlapping activities, organizers ensure a smooth flow of events and maximize attendee engagement.
3. **Employee Shift Scheduling**: In industries with shift-based work schedules, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and retail, managers need to assign tasks to employees while ensuring adequate coverage and minimizing overtime costs. Selecting the most efficient combination of shifts helps optimize workforce management.

## Maximum Possible Equal Sum of 3 Stacks

### Overview

Given three stacks of positive numbers, the task is to find the maximum possible equal sum of the stacks with the removal of top elements allowed.

### Input

- **Three Stacks**: Three stacks of positive numbers.

### Output

- **Maximum Equal Sum**: The maximum possible equal sum of the three stacks.

### Real-life Use Cases

1. **Lucky Wheel at a Casino**: In a lucky wheel game at a casino, the winner is announced if and only if a non-empty solution of the maximum possible equal sum exists. By calculating the maximum possible equal sum, the casino ensures fairness and determines the winning conditions for the lucky wheel game.
